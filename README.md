# Qr Enhanced Inventory Management System

Qr Enhanced Inventory Management System is a web-based application for managing inventory with QR code integration. This system allows users to efficiently manage their inventory by scanning QR codes associated with each product.

The proposed project, entitled " QR Code Enhanced Inventory Management System " aims to streamline the ordering and tracking process for users, managers, and shipperswithin a store. The system consists of three distinct logins: user, manager, and
shipper.Upon logging in, users can select products of their choice, initiating the generation of a unique QR code that serves as a tracking identifier for their order. This QR code eliminates the need for users to repeatedly log in to check the order status, as
they can simply scan the code to access real-time updates.Simultaneously, managers of the respective store to which the products belong receive notifications of incoming orders. Upon receiving an order, the manager can review and accept it, triggering a
notification to the shipper that the product is ready for shipping. Furthermore, the system captures location details during the ordering process. This information ensures that the shipping agency serving the specified location receives the order. In case of conflicts between different agencies, the order is assigned to the agency that accepts it first, ensuring efficient and timely delivery.Overall, the QR Code Enhanced Inventory Management System enhances efficiency, transparency, and communication throughout the ordering and shipping process, benefiting users, managers, and shippers alike.
